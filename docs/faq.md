# FAQ

This FAQ is a work in progress designed to answer the questions our users most frequently ask about Rancher Desktop.

**A:** No, Rancher Desktop is not [Rancher] on the desktop. Installing Rancher Desktop does not install Rancher, but you can install Rancher as a workload.

Rancher Desktop is similar to applications like [minikube], [kind], or [Docker Desktop] where the goal is to have an easy to set up local Kubernetes environment to manage containers.

**Q: Can I have Docker Desktop installed alongside Rancher Desktop?**

**A:** Yes, there are no conflicts having both installed.

For Rancher Desktop v0.6.1 and earlier, you can even run both simultaneously if resources permit. This may change for future releases.
