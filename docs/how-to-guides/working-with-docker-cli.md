title: Working with Docker CLI
---

[Moby](https://github.com/moby/moby) is an open-source project that was created by Docker to enable and accelerate software containerization. Components include container build tools, a container registry, orchestration tools, and a runtime, et al. The Docker CLI uses the Moby runtime. 

## Images

Please refer to the [documentation](./how-to-guides/working-with-images.md) to learn how to build, list, tag, and remove images using the Docker CLI and the Moby runtime.

## Running Containers

[PLACEHOLDER]

## Docker Compose

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. 

The `compose` command in the Docker CLI supports most of the `docker-compose` commands and flags. It is expected to be a drop-in replacement for `docker-compose`.
